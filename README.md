Sonoff SWV Zigbee valve wall holder

A while back I got one of these water valves to automate watering the garden, I integrated it with zigbee2mqtt which works really well for it and set it up to water the garden, my issue was I hated how it looked sticking onto the end of the tap. Thus set about moving it off the tap and attaching the valve to the wall.

I designed a print which held the valve tightly and kept it as close to the wall whilst allowing enough space to pull the battery compartment out without having to remove the whole unit. This is the design I ended up with. This is free for anyone else to use and edit. I will be posting to Thingiverse as well but trying to centralise Github incase I ever develop any code for any of my prints.
